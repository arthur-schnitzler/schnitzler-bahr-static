# Arthur Schnitzler, Hermann Bahr: Briefwechsel, Aufzeichnungen, Dokumente (1891â€“1931). Website (no data)

This application fetches the data from this repository: https://github.com/arthur-schnitzler/schnitzler-bahr-data and deploys it as a website. The future address will be https://schnitzler-bahr.acdh.oeaw.ac.at but currently only the previous website is online: https://bahrschnitzler.acdh.oeaw.ac.at

Addressed (and mostly solved) are several shortcomings of the previous iteration. Also included is a closer integration with other biographical sources of Arthur Schnitzler developped at the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH) at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, see: https://schnitzler.acdh.oeaw.ac.at

* build with [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter)
